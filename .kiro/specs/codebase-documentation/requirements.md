# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates comprehensive documentation for the existing AWS Bedrock chatbot application built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and CoreUI. The application provides real-time streaming chat functionality using AWS Bedrock Agent Runtime, with sophisticated state management, error handling, and responsive UI components. The documentation will serve as a complete reference for developers working with this codebase, covering architecture, implementation details, API references, and development workflows.

## Glossary

- **AWS_Bedrock_Service**: The core service class that handles AWS Bedrock Agent Runtime integration and streaming responses
- **Chat_Store**: Pinia store managing chat state, messages, streaming status, and error handling
- **Message_Components**: Vue components for displaying and managing chat messages (MessageItem, MessageList, MessageInput, ChatContainer)
- **Streaming_Handler**: System component that processes real-time streaming responses from AWS Bedrock
- **Configuration_System**: Environment-based configuration management for AWS credentials and agent settings
- **Type_System**: TypeScript interfaces and type guards for ensuring type safety across the application
