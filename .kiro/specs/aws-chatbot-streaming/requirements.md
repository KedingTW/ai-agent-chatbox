# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AWS chatbot conversation window that provides real-time streaming responses using AWS Bedrock Agent Runtime. The chatbot will display messages in a conversational interface where users can send messages and receive streaming responses from AWS Bedrock agents, providing a smooth and responsive user experience similar to modern chat applications.

The application is built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and CoreUI, following modern development practices with comprehensive testing using Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for end-to-end testing. The development workflow supports hot-reload development, production builds, and code quality checks through linting and formatting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to an AWS Bedrock agent, so that I can have interactive conversations with AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types a message in the input field THEN the system SHALL display the message in the conversation window
2. WHEN a user submits a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to AWS Bedrock Agent Runtime using InvokeAgentRuntimeCommand
3. WHEN the message is being processed THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to indicate the agent is responding
4. IF the message submission fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see agent responses appear in real-time as they are generated, so that I can follow the conversation naturally without waiting for complete responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AWS Bedrock agent starts responding THEN the system SHALL detect the "text/event-stream" content type
2. WHEN streaming data is received THEN the system SHALL parse each chunk and display the content incrementally in the conversation window
3. WHEN new content chunks arrive THEN the system SHALL append them to the current response message without flickering or jumping
4. WHEN the stream ends THEN the system SHALL finalize the response and allow for new user input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a clear conversation history with proper message formatting, so that I can easily distinguish between my messages and the agent's responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly differentiate between user messages and agent responses using visual styling
2. WHEN multiple messages exist THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order with timestamps
3. WHEN the conversation window has many messages THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
4. WHEN a new message is added THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment in the conversation flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand what went wrong and continue using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS Bedrock API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL show appropriate connection error messages
3. WHEN streaming is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the partial response gracefully and allow retry
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on resolving the authentication issue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management and keyboard shortcuts
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements for new messages
4. WHEN messages are long THEN the system SHALL handle text wrapping and maintain readability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage for the chat functionality, so that I can ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run with `yarn test:unit` THEN the system SHALL execute all component and service tests using Vitest
2. WHEN end-to-end tests are run with `yarn test:e2e` THEN the system SHALL test complete user workflows using Playwright
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL pass all linting checks with `yarn lint`
4. WHEN code formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL use Prettier with 4-space indentation and 100-character line width

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a smooth development workflow with hot-reload and build processes, so that I can efficiently develop and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `yarn dev` THEN the system SHALL start a development server with hot-reload capabilities
2. WHEN running `yarn build` THEN the system SHALL create an optimized production build with type checking
3. WHEN running `yarn type-check:all` THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive code quality checks including TypeScript, linting, and formatting
4. WHEN running `yarn preview` THEN the system SHALL serve the production build for testing
